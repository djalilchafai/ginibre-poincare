# The normalized complex Gaussian probability measure

For `n` particles, each real coordinate has variance `1 / (2n)`.  We first
use Mathlib's normalized real Gaussian probability measure, take two
independent copies to obtain one complex coordinate, and then take the finite
product over the particle labels.

This construction proves the probability normalization without evaluating a
multidimensional integral.  Identification with the explicit density
`(n / π)^n exp (-n |z|²)` is deliberately kept as a separate theorem target in
`MeasureModel.lean`.
